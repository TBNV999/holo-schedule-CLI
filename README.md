# holo-schedule-CLI
This branch is  a test branch. Plese do not execute it.

# Requirement
- Python 3.x
- requests

- Japanese font (In order to display hololive member's name)

# Usage
By executing main\.py You can get information like these:
- The time hololive streams will start in JST
- Who is streaming
- The streaming URL

# Notes
This program is a scraping tool. [The source page](https://schedule.hololive.tv/simple) 
says the schedule is updated every 15 minutes so this program might not deal with the latest changes. 
If you never want to miss any stream, it is recommended to follow the hololive member's Twitter account.  

I will update to add an option to show the schedule without Japanese fonts.
